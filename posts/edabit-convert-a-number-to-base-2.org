* The Problem Statement (from Edabit)
#+begin_quote
Create a function that returns a base-2 (binary) representation of a base-10 (decimal) string number. To convert is simple: ((2) means base-2 and (10) means base-10) 010101001(2) = 1 + 8 + 32 + 128.

Going from right to left, the value of the most right bit is 1, now from that every bit to the left will be x2 the value, value of an 8 bit binary numbers are (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1).
#+end_quote

Examples

#+begin_src python
binary(1) ➞ "1"
binary(5) ➞ "101"
binary(10) ➞ "1010"
#+end_src

**Notes**

    - Numbers will always be below 1024 (not including 1024).
    - The strings will always go to the length at which the most left bit's value gets bigger than the number in decimal.
    - If a binary conversion for 0 is attempted, return "0".
